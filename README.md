Resume and presentation of skills - 

  Hello and welcome to my own personal resume and projects portfolio. My name is Brendan Carlo and I am an entirely self taught designer. From the design and concept tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator and PremierPro to the more techinical side of things like Html, CSS and basic Javascript. It has been an unending journey, filled with a ton of information but always ending in a satisfication that rivals no other, making all the hours of digging and troublshooting all the more worth it. If your one of the few whom have actually taken the time to review my work, I am grateful for the consideration and any information your willing to share im willing and able to learn. Thank you!
                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  -Brendan Carlo
